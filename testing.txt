**User Persona:**

-This is a website used for people (most likely located in the Seattle area, but not limited to) looking to adopt a dog.
-The users are going to be a range from young adult to older adult/seniors.
-Because of the age range of users and technology using ability, the website needs to be easily navigated.
-The users of the website will be using a range of devices including desktop, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. 
-Both older and new technology will be used as some users may be using their older outdated devices or new up-to-date publicly available devices.
-The websites user base will also include people who may not want to adopt online, instead prefer to make the transaction in person or over the phone. So the contact info and location need to be easily found.



**Website QA Testing**

__Visual Testing:__
The website has been tested in many ways ensure the best user experience possible. Some of the first things tested for was visual consistency. Font style, size and colors were found consistent across all web pages. The same was observed for links. Each web page also maintained consistent alignment, spacing, padding, and margins. All images and visuals were visible and remained in their correct location even as the window size changes.

Functional Testing:
Next, the website was tested to make sure the features worked as the user would expect. First each link was tested to verify its destination. The CSS and HTML pages all passed a code validator. The form also was tested and shows the user when a required box has not been filled.

Accessibility Testing:
Because many people in the world live with some form of disability, the website was tested for accessibility. The website did not pass some accessibility tests, so the some colors and hover features were changed in order to pass. Each page was tested with different levels of zoom to make sure the web pages were still fully visible and functions. All the images contain detailed alt text for visually impaired users 

Responsive and Cross-Browser Testing:
The website was opened in 3 different web browsers including Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari on MacOS. All 3 browsers showed similar experiences. 
-The layout is fluid and well centered. When adjusting the window size, the content fit within the viewing port size. Text size remained legible and shifted so it isn’t hidden (there is no scrolling horizontally to view hidden content).
-Each browser maintains sufficient padding and margins.
-Some changes that could be made is better breakpoints for certain viewport sizes. May want to use a different layout for smaller screen sizes. Some content would benefit from moving the text placed to the side of an image to underneath the image so the image can maintain its size.

Emulator Responsive Testing:
The developer tools were utilized in each of the 3 browsers. Using the emulator/responsive view tool, I tested the website on different devices like mobile, desktop, and tablets.

	Firefox:
	Using the emulator in Firefox, the tablet device tested was the Kindle Fire. The mobile devices tested were Galaxy Note 20 and Google Pixel 5. They all displayed similar to a desktop.
	Chrome:
	Using the emulator in Chrome, the tablet devices tested were iPad mini and iPad Pro. As for mobile devices, Samsung Galaxy Ultra and Google Pixel 7 were tested. Both device types maintained similar usability as desktop browsers.
	Safari:
	Using the emulator in Safari, the mobile devices tested were iPhone 8 and iPhone SE. Because there was no access to a different operating system, Safari’s developer tools offer an option of viewing the website from different operating systems with the emulator. Here the website was viewed on each of the 3 browsers inanition to Microsoft Edge on both MacOS and Windows. One key thing to note about the windows operating system on each browser was the space between the drop-down arrow and the menu choice was very short. This resulted in the arrow covering a small portion of the text.

Mobile Device Testing:
The website was also tested on an actual android mobile device (Galaxy S22). It was an expected experience and performed as it did during the emulator. It was clear that the layout does need to be adjusted for smaller screen sizes.
